# Mathematical Analysis

## 1. How many possible keys or codes could there be?
     - There are only 25 possible keys when using the Ceaser cipher. 


## 2. How would you attempt to decode this message if you didn't have the key?
     - Due to the fact that there are only 25 keys, Ceaser ciphers are very succeptible to a brute force attack in which you would try every combination. 


## 3. What is the mathematical complexity to solve the code?
     - The formula of encryption is: En (x) = (x + n) mod 26
     - The formula of decryption is: Dn (x) = (xi - n) mod 26
     - There is not much mathematical complexity for this cipher if you are able to just brute force it quite easily.
