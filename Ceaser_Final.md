# Final Analysis

## Why did this stop being useful?
- It can be easily broken even using brute force methods which makes its security benefits almost usless.

## What made it useful when it was being used?
- It was being used in around 100 BC by Julius Ceaser to send messages to his generals in the field. It was useful because in the case that the messages got      intercepted, they could not be read by the enemies. 

## What are other interesting uses of this code or similar codes?
- Ceaser cipher is not used in modern cryptography, but the shift algorithm was used to create complicated ciphers like affine, baconian, and transposition cipher.
