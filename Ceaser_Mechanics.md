##Mechaics of a Ceaser Cipher

A Ceaser Cipher is one of the simpler Cipher known to man. It works by shifting letters in the alphabet a certain amount of places to created a different alphabet that is used to encrypt the words.

In order to decrypt a Ceaser Cipher you need to find the amount you need to shift the alphabet back.

This type of Cipher is symmetric since the key you use to encrypt it (the amount you shift the alphabet) is also what's used to decrypt it.
