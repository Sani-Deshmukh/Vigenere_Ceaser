# Mathematical Analysis

## 1. How many possible keys or codes could there be?
     -  Although the viginere cipher works off of the alphabet, if you were to use a 5 letter key there would be 26^5 or 11,881,376 combinations for the key.


## 2. How would you attempt to decode this message if you didn't have the key?
     -  You would try to figure out the length of the key and then proceed to design a program to brute force the rest of the combinations. 


## 3. What is the mathematical complexity to solve the code?
     - The complexity depends on the length of the key that you are using. Say if you were using a 6 letter key word the combinations would be 26^6.
